				<u>About:-</u>
			</h1>
			<p>
				☛ Amis was born on 25 August 1949 at Radcliffe Maternity Hospital in Oxford, England.<br><br>
				☛ His father, novelist Kingsley Amis, was the son of a mustard manufacturer's clerk from Clapham, London and his mother, Kingston upon Thames-born Hilary ("Hilly") Ann Bardwell, was the daughter of a Ministry of Agriculture civil servant.<br><br>
				☛ He is best known for his novels Money (1984) and London Fields (1989).<br><br>
				☛  He received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his memoir Experience and was twice listed for the Booker Prize (shortlisted in 1991 for Time's Arrow and longlisted in 2003 for Yellow Dog)<br><br>
				☛ Amis served as Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Manchester's Centre for New Writing from 2007 until 2011<br><br> 
				☛ Amis's work centres on the excesses of <strong>"late-capitalist"</strong> Western society, whose perceived absurdity he often satirised through grotesque caricature; he was portrayed by some literary critics as a master of what The New York Times called <strong>"the new unpleasantness"</strong>.<br><br>
				☛ A lifelong smoker, Amis died from oesophageal cancer at his house in the US state of Florida on 19 May 2023
				<br><br>  The New York Times wrote after his death: <i>"To come of reading age in the last three decades of the 20th century — from the oil embargo through the fall of the Berlin Wall, all the way to 9/11 — was to live, it now seems clear, in the Amis Era."</i>
